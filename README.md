# OOPS Banner App

## Project Overview
The **OOPS Banner App** is a Java console-based application developed to demonstrate
core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts along with a structured
**Git/GitFlow-based development process**.

The application prints banner-style patterns and is enhanced incrementally through
multiple **Use Cases (UCs)**. Each use case represents a new improvement, refactoring,
or concept addition to the application.

## Git Branching Strategy
This project follows a structured GitFlow approach with the following branches:

### Main Branch (`main`)
- Contains only project documentation files:
  - `README.md`
  - `.gitignore`
- No application source code is maintained in this branch.

### Development Branch (`develop`)
- Contains the latest stable and working version of the application.
- All completed use cases are merged into this branch.

### Feature Branches (`feature/*`)
- Each use case is implemented in a separate feature branch.
- Branch naming convention:
